# The CNO1d code has been modified from a tutorial featured in the 
# ETH Zurich course "AI in the Sciences and Engineering."
# Git page for this course: https://github.com/bogdanraonic3/AI_Science_Engineering 

# For up/downsampling, the antialias interpolation functions from the 
# torch library are utilized, limiting the ability to design
# your own low-pass filters at present.

# While acknowledging this suboptimal setup, the performance of CNO1d remains commendable. 
# Additionally, a training script is available, offering a solid foundation for personal projects.
